# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic map showing the tectonic plates, all earthquakes in the last 30 days, and major earthquakes (of magnitude 4.5 or more) in the last 7 days. Each circle in the map represent an earthquake and its color and size is relative to its magnitude. We created different layers to allow the user change his perspective of the map and extract his own conclusions, we also add pop ups that says the specific magnitude and location of the earthquake. We made this project using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Leaflet and Mapbox
